# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

DoomLegacy 1.48.18, a source port of Doom/Heretic descended from id Software's original engine, at
SVN revision r1749 of the `legacy_one/trunk` repository. This is a plain source dump (no `.git`
directory) — there is no git history to inspect, and no test suite; it is a C99 game engine built
with GNU Make (a CMake file also exists but is secondary/less maintained, SDL-only, and not kept in
sync with all Makefile options).

The actual source tree is under `svn1749/`. The top-level `bin/`, `dep/`, `objs/`, `make_options`,
and the `srcdir` symlink are leftover build-output scaffolding from the original packager's machine;
`srcdir` is a **dangling symlink** (points to a path on the original author's machine) and is not
usable as-is. Always work under `svn1749/`.

## Build

Building must happen from `svn1749/src/` (the Makefile there locates the rest of the build via
relative paths and drops `bin/`, `objs/`, `dep/` in `svn1749/`, one level up from `src/`).

```
cd svn1749/src
cp ../make_options_nix ../make_options   # first time only; pick _win/_mac/_os2/_dos as appropriate
make                                      # builds using ../make_options
```

Key `make_options` variables (set in the copied file, not on the CLI, to avoid repeating them every
invocation):
- `SMIF` — system media interface: `SDL` (default), `LINUX_X11`, `FREEBSD_X11`, `OS2_NATIVE`, `DOS_NATIVE`.
- `OS` — defaults based on `SMIF` (e.g. `LINUX_X11` implies `OS=LINUX`).
- `HAVE_MIXER=1` — enable SDL_mixer music.
- `DEBUG=1` — debug build (can also target a separate `BUILD=debug` output directory).
- `ARCH=-march=...` — CPU-specific optimization.

Useful targets: `make clean`, `make distclean` (also removes `make_options`), `make depend`,
`make BUILD=<dir>` (build into an alternate output directory), `make DEBUG=1 BUILD=debug`.

Do not run the built binary from inside the build tree — it expects to run from an installed
directory (see `make install`, `install_user`, `install_sys`, `install_games` targets, or just copy
everything from `bin/` to a run directory alongside a `legacy.wad`).

There is no automated test suite; validating a change means building and running the game
interactively (or asking the user to).

## Compile-time feature flags

Most engine features are toggled in `svn1749/src/doomdef.h` via `#define`, independent of the Make
options (e.g. `SPLITSCREEN`, `FRAGGLESCRIPT`, `VOODOO_DOLL`, `BOOM_GLOBAL_COLORMAP`, `SAVEGAME99`).
Comment/uncomment there for engine behavior changes; use `make_options`/Makefile only for
platform/toolchain/library selection.

## Architecture

The codebase is the classic Doom engine module layout, extended by the Legacy team. Prefixes on
source files are meaningful and consistently used across the tree:

- **`d_*`** — top-level game/doom driver: `d_main.c` (`D_DoomMain`, main loop, arg parsing, game
  mode detection), `d_net.c`/`d_clisrv.c`/`d_netcmd.c`/`d_netfil.c`/`i_tcp.c` — the client/server
  networking layer (DoomLegacy games are always run through a client/server protocol, even
  single-player, via `d_clisrv.c`'s "High Level Client/Server communications").
- **`p_*`** — play/game-logic simulation: map setup (`p_setup.c`), physics/collision (`p_map*.c`,
  `p_maputl.c`), mobj thinking (`p_mobj.c`, `p_enemy.c`, `p_user.c`, `p_inter.c`), specials/doors/
  plats/floors/lights (`p_spec.c`, `p_doors.c`, `p_plats.c`, `p_floor.c`, `p_lights.c`, `p_ceilng.c`,
  `p_switch.c`, `p_genlin.c`), and savegame I/O (`p_saveg.c`). This is the largest subsystem.
- **`r_*`** — the software renderer: BSP traversal (`r_bsp.c`), segments/planes/sprites
  (`r_segs.c`, `r_plane.c`, `r_things.c`), drawing (`r_draw.c`), main render loop (`r_main.c`).
- **`hardware/`** — the OpenGL/3D-accelerated renderer (`hw_main.c`, `hw_bsp.c`, `hw_draw.c`,
  `hw_cache.c`, `hw_md2.c` for models), with pluggable low-level GPU backends under
  `hardware/r_opengl/`, `r_glide/`, `r_minigl/`, `r_d3d/` (mostly legacy/Windows-era backends;
  `r_opengl` is the one in active use) and 3D positional audio in `hardware/s_ds3d/`.
- **`t_*`** — FraggleScript, an embedded scripting language for WAD-driven level scripting
  (`t_parse.c`, `t_script.c`, `t_prepro.c`, `t_vari.c`, `t_oper.c`, `t_func.c`, `t_array.c`).
- **`b_*`** — the bot AI (`b_game.c` bot logic/commands, `b_look.c` target acquisition, `b_node.c`/
  `b_search.c` pathfinding over the map's node graph).
- **`w_*`** — WAD file handling: `w_wad.c` (header/directory/lump I/O), `w_zip.c` (zip-based WADs,
  needs libzip).
- **`m_*`** — misc/support: `m_menu.c` (the entire options/setup menu system), `m_misc.c`,
  `m_cheat.c`, `m_random.c`, `m_fixed.c` (fixed-point math), `m_argv.c`.
- **`console.c` / `command.c`** — the in-game console and its command/cvar system; `command.c`'s
  console variables (`consvar_t`) are the primary mechanism for exposing tunables to players and
  the network protocol, each optionally backed by a callback function fired on change.
- **`dehacked.c`** — DeHackEd/BEX patch loader (runtime modification of `info.c` tables/strings).
- **`info.c`/`info.h`** — the generated-style tables of thing/state/sprite/sound definitions;
  `infoext.c`/`infoext.h` hold Legacy's extensions to the vanilla tables. `info.c.orig` is a
  reference copy of the pre-modification vanilla table, not a build input.
- **`umapinfo/`** — a separate, mostly self-contained UMAPINFO lump parser (lexer/parser/keywords)
  used to read modern map-metadata lumps from WADs.
- **Platform SMIF backends** (System Media Interface — the abstraction over OS/windowing/input/
  sound): `sdl/` (primary, cross-platform), `linux_x/` (native X11), `win32/`, `os2/`, `macos/`,
  `djgppdos/`. Only one is compiled in per build, selected by `SMIF`/`OS` in `make_options`. Files
  duplicated across these directories (`i_main.c`, `i_system.c`, `i_video.c`, `i_sound.c`, etc.)
  implement the same `i_*` interface declared in the shared headers (`i_system.h`, `i_video.h`,
  `i_sound.h`, `i_net.h`, `i_joy.h`) — when changing platform-facing behavior, check whether the
  change needs to be mirrored across backends.
- **`doomincl.h`**, **`doomdef.h`**, **`doomtype.h`**, **`doomstat.h`** — the common includes almost
  every `.c` file starts with; `doomincl.h` is explicitly documented as "not used in headers" (only
  include it from `.c` files, not from other `.h` files) to avoid include-order problems.

### Networking model

DoomLegacy has no separate single-player code path: even solo play runs a local client/server pair
through `d_clisrv.c`. This matters when changing game-state-affecting code (e.g. `p_*`, `g_game.c`)
— such changes must stay in sync across net play (deterministic simulation from `ticcmd_t` input),
not just work locally. Console variables and commands that affect gameplay are typically networked
(see `command.c`'s netcmd handling and `d_netcmd.c`).

### Message/logging

Don't use raw `printf`/`fprintf` for engine diagnostics — use the routines declared in
`doomincl.h`: `CONS_Printf` (routes through `EOUT_flags`), `GenPrintf(EMSG_*, ...)` (categorized
info/debug/dev/warn/error messages fanned out to console/log/stderr per `EMSG_e`/`EOUT_e`), or
`I_Error`/`I_SoftError` for fatal/recoverable engine errors.
